# quartermasters
E-commerce website made by one of my colleague and me for my e-commerce class project during my Computer Science Technology degree back in Vanier College

# What is a quartermaster?
Quartermaster is a military term, the meaning of which depends on the country and service. In land armies, a quartermaster is generally a relatively senior soldier who supervises stores or barracks and distributes supplies and provisions. In our case, we made it into a website where soldiers can purchase military equipment from the quartermaster (the admin that has control over the website).

# Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to make a fully functional e-commerce website using php and mysql databases using phpmyadmin where a user can register or login and make purchases by adding items into their cart, as well as updating and deleting items from the cart, and then proceed by checking out with their card information. Once purchases are made, clients can then review their orders and order history from their account information page. A member can also modify their password as well as username. Anonymous users are able to visit but purchases cannot be made since you must have an account (only soldiers can make purchases). Limited quantities are set per article since there are no such thing as infinite supplies and it is the Admins role (the quartermaster) to restock on items that are low in quantity.
