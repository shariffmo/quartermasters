# What is a quartermaster?
Quartermaster is a military term, the meaning of which depends on the country and service. In land armies, a quartermaster is generally a relatively senior soldier who supervises stores or barracks and distributes supplies and provisions. In our case, we made it into a website where soldiers can purchase military equipment from the quartermaster (in this case the admin that has control over the website).
